/**
 * Current subscription entitlement for the authenticated user.
 *
 * Named `Premium` (not `Pro`) deliberately: entitlement names are technical
 * identifiers, decoupled from marketing names. If the product tier is ever
 * sold as "KIRU+ Pro", "KIRU+ Plus", or anything else, this enum stays stable
 * and avoids naming drift between code and App Store / Play Store listings.
 *
 * The Android implementation resolves this state via RevenueCat once a valid
 * `goog_` API key is configured (Sprint B / task A7).
 * Until then, [EntitlementState.Free] is the safe default — no content is
 * ever unlocked erroneously.
